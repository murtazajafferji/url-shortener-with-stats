# Backend Code Challenge

## Problem

Implement a simple URL shortening web service (like [tinyurl](http://tinyurl.com/)) using the Python [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs) (or similar) web framework. This service will allow clients to create and delete unique identifiers for an arbitrary set of URLs and, provided a valid identifier, redirect a client to the target URL.

## Running
Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
```commandline
python -m venv url-shortener
```
Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.

On Windows, run:
```commandline
url-shortener\Scripts\activate
```
On Unix or MacOS, run:
```commandline
source url-shortener/bin/activate
```
Run the following commands install Python modules and initialize the database
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.db.setup
```
Run the following command to start the Flask application
```commandline
python run.py
```

## Testing
All requirements are covered by tests. To run the tests, run one of the commands below.

On Windows, run:
```commandline
python -m pytest -v
```

On Unix or MacOS, run:
```commandline
py.test -v
```

## Requirements (completed)

 1. Expose an endpoint to create a new shortened URL.
    * must optionally accept a user-provided ID for the shortened URL, otherwise generate one randomly
    * must not accept or generate a duplicate ID
    * must validate that IDs are non-empty and only contain alphanumeric characters
    * must include in the response a unique "authorization" token, which is different from the URL ID and may be used to delete or get additional stats about the shortened URL
    * must include in the response the shortened URL, constructed as follows: `http://{serverHostname}:{serverPort}/{urlId}`
 2. Expose an endpoint to delete an existing shortened URL.
    * must only allow deletion if the "authorization" token that was generated on creation is provided with the request
 3. Redirect valid, shortened URLs to the original full URL.
    * must keep track of successful redirects, per unique client IP address
 4. Expose an endpoint to retrieve stats about successful redirects for a shortened URL.
    * must only return stats if the "authorization" token that was generated on creation is provided with the request
    * must report counts of successful redirects per unique client IP address over the lifetime of the shortened URL

### Additional Requirements (completed)

 * Your code is expected to run on Python 3.7+.
 * You may use Flask as the web framework, but may use another web framework if you so choose.
 * You are free to use any third-party Python modules that are installable via `pip`. If you do, you must add the relevant dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file.
 * You may use the provided modules in the `db` package to intialize and interface with a SQLite database, but you may use another datastore (persistent or in-memory, relational or non-relational) of your choosing. In this case, you must *write code* to setup the database schema and *document* your database configuration or any additional setup that is required to run your application.

### Optional Requirements (completed)

 * Set a default expiration time when a shortened URL is created. After the time has expired, the shortened URL should fail to redirect, and the web service should not allow further operations on the expired URL ID, but should allow a new shortened URL to be created with that ID.
 * Prevent simple DoS or brute force attacks by restricting the number of requests a particular client can make to the service within a certain timeframe.

 ### Example

For example, assuming a web application running on `localhost:8080`, it would support the following interaction:
```
curl -v -XPOST \
     -H"Content-type: application/json" \
     -d'{"url":"http://www.example.com"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/create
> POST /create HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.79.1
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 30
> Content-Type: application/json
>
< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 95
< Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.1

     -H"Authorization: donjo2ef938gfo2h" \
     http://localhost:8080/hrms3zw

```

Windows:
```
$headers = @{
    "Content-type" = "application/json"
}

$body = '{"url":"http://www.example.com"}'

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8080/create" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -Verbose
```
### Endpoint Specification

**`POST /create`**

Generate and return a new, unique ID that can later be used to redirect to the provided URL. The `url` parameter must be a well-formed URL, but does not necessarily need to exist or be available.

A successful request must return with a status code `200` and a JSON object with valid `urlId`, `shortUrl`, and `authToken` values.

Otherwise, an invalid request must return with a status code `400` and a plain text error message.

##### Request
*application/json*

Body Parameters:

    url     (required - string): A well-formatted URL
    id      (optional - string): A non-empty string identifier for URL

Example:

    {
        "url": "http://www.example.com"
    }

##### Responses
Status `200` (success): *application/json*

    {
        "shortUrl": "string",
        "urlId": "string",
        "authToken": "string"
    }

Status `400` (error):

    Error Message
---
**`GET /{urlId}`**

Given a valid `urlId`, redirect the client to the target URL with a status code `301`.

An invalid request must return with a status code `404` and a plain text error message.

##### Responses
Status `301` (success)

Status `404` (error):

    Error Message
---
**`GET /{urlId}/stats`**

Given a valid `urlId`, return with a status code `200` and a JSON object with numeric counts of successful redirects, per unique client IP address.

A request with a missing or incorrect `authToken` must return with a status code `403` and a plain text error message.

An invalid request must return with a status code `404` and a plain text error message.

##### Request

Request Headers:

    Authorization  (required - string): The authToken associated with the urlId

##### Responses
Status `200` (success): *application/json*

    {
        "ip_address_1": int,
        "ip_address_2": int,
        ...
    }

Status `403` (error):

    Error Message

Status `404` (error):

    Error Message
---
**`DELETE /{urlId}`**

Given a valid `urlId`, remove the mapping to the target URL. A subsequent `GET` request with the `urlId` should yield a `404` response.

A request with a missing or incorrect `authToken` must return with a status code `403` and a plain text error message.

An invalid request must return with a status code `404` and a plain text error message.

##### Request

Request Headers:

    Authorization  (required - string): The authToken associated with the urlId

##### Responses
Status `204` (success)

Status `403` (error):

    Error Message

Status `404` (error):

The following modules are provided for you as a starting point for your web application:

```
.
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── run.py
└── src
    └── db
        ├── __init__.py
        └── setup.py
        └── schema.sql
    ├── __init__.py
    └── routes.py
```

You may modify any of the provided application code and define new modules and/or functions as long as your application starts a webserver bound to port `8080` on `localhost` and is runnable via one of the following methods:

* Local installation of Python (or a virtualenv):
  ```
  python -m run
  ```

* Docker:
  ```
  docker build -t code-challenge:latest .
  docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 code-challenge:latest
  ```

### Modules
`run.py`

Imports the routes module and runs the webserver on `localhost:8080`. You can run the webserver from the top-level directory with the following command: `python -m run`

You may also run the webserver in a Docker container using the provided Dockerfile:
```
docker build -t code-challenge:latest .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 code-challenge:latest
```

`src/__init__.py`

The Flask application object is initialized in this file.

`src/routes.py`

Defines the routes, as specified in the `Endpoint Specification` section - these are the functions that you must implement.

`src/db/__init__.py`

Provides a simple wrapper around a `sqlite3` database connection. You are free to use this module as-is, modify it, or ignore it.

`src/db/setup.py`
`src/db/schema.sql`

Initializes a local SQLite database via the SQL commands defined in the `schema.sql` file. If you choose to the provided setup code, the `schema.sql` script should be idempotent and runnable from the top-level directory with the following command: `python -m src.db.setup`
